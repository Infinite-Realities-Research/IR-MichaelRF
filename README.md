## Description
Infinite-Realities presents a 30-second long 60fps recording of a presentation delivered by Michael Rubloff from [radiancefields.com](https://radiancefields.com/) captured in the [AeonX: D∆êUS motion scanning system](https://www.ir-ltd.net/ir/deus/).

The setup for this capture comprises of 176 [ximea](https://www.ximea.com/) 12 MP machine vision cameras and 484 [Ida-Tronic](https://ida-tronic.com/) Photon LED lights with RGB (red, green, and blue) filters.

The lighting was programmed to change every 6 seconds (360 frames) going through the following states: GI (global illumination), Blade Runner 2049 Orange, Neon Red, Enchanting Aqua, and RGB Normals.


## Dataset Details
This dataset contains the following:

- 1800 frames pre-registered as COLMAP Pinhole model format with undistorted images
- 1800 Gaussian Splat .ply frames trained as individual frames, cleaned with the background and floor removed
- Synchronized Audio .wav file

The **IR-Spatial-Humans** demo can be run in Desktop mode or VR mode from the same app. For VR, it's recommended to use the Meta Quest Link app and a Quest 3; the demo cannot be run standalone on the headset. Please read the included readme for more information.

*This Desktop/VR demo contains an early version of the trained .ply files. The new dataset release was trained with images from an updated image pipeline and newer training method.*
